The murder of Caesar for providing abundant money shows the deadly stakes when leaders oppose money-changer interests."

And I think that is a function of the fact that **some of these institutions have become too large**"

- Interviewer: "Why?"
- Trader: "Because people don't seem to maybe remember, but the 30s depression wasn't just about a market crash. There were some people who were prepared to make money from that crash. And I think anybody can do that. Anybody can actually make money. **It's an opportunity**"
- Key Quote: "This economic crisis is like a cancer. If you just wait thinking this is going to go away, just like a cancer, it's going to grow. What I would say to everybody is **get prepared**.

- Regling: "I have answered a similar question. I addressed the question."
- Irish: "You addressed the questions previously, but..."
- Regling talks about difficult decision, balance, confidence in banking system, etc.
- Irish: **"We are required to pay in respect of a defunct bank. There's no bearing on welfare of Irish people at all. We're required to pay billions on unguaranteed bonds in order to ensure the health of European banks. How would you explain that to the taxi driver?"**
- Regling: "I think I have addressed the question."
- Irish: **"No, you haven't addressed the question because you've referred to viability of Irish financial institutions. This financial institution I'm talking about is defunct. It's over. It's finished. Now, why are the Irish people required under threat from the ECB to pay billions to unguaranteed bond holders? You didn't answer the question the last time, so maybe you'd answer it this time"**
- Moderator: "I think he doesn't have anything to add to what he's already said"
