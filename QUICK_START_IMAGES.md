## 🚀 Progressive Addition Strategy

Don't feel pressured to get all 83 images at once! Add them progressively:

**Phase 1**: Federal Reserve (13 images) - Most critical
**Phase 2**: Ancient Foundations (2 images) - Has infographic  
**Phase 3**: Industrial Revolution (4 images) - Has infographic
**Phase 4**: Medieval Banking (6 images) - Has infographic
**Phase 5**: Other chapters - Add as you find good images

The site will work perfectly fine with some missing images. They'll just be blank until you add them.

## 💡 If You Can't Find an Exact Image

**Don't stress!** Here are alternatives:

- **For people**: Use any portrait from that era
- **For buildings**: Use any similar historic building
- **For documents**: Use any similar document from that period
- **For events**: Use related imagery from same time period
- **For charts**: You can create simple charts yourself from data

The **content and infographics** are more important than perfect historical images. Good enough > perfect!
